For a python3 midi analysis propose, there's a very nice start base on https://salu133445.github.io/pypianoroll/getting_started.html

This file is a reminder for myself for some details.

To analyze a midi file, for me, the first step is to convert a midi file to an array where x-axis is time and y-axis is pitch, pypianoroll 
does provide a very nice tool for this.
